Kingdoms is about forging alliances, political mind games, city-building and castle sieges with thousands of other players. Cast as a feudal lord or lady, players begin with a single village and keep. They must design and defend their castle before turning their eye to the rest of the country, Europe and the world! Whatever path they choose players will find strength in numbers as they band together, uniting with local Factions and player-led Houses.\r\n\r\nBesiege the castle that’s never been taken, overthrow ruthless tyrants, bankroll your faction’s war efforts, pillage your neighbor’s resources, peacefully raise cattle or do it all! Factions, elections, liege lords and their vassals come together to form a feudal community of real players with whom to discuss strategies and build allegiances.\r\n \r\nWhile an impregnable castle should be at the heart of any kingdom, you can also specialize with a vast research tree. Starting as a humble peasant each promotion provides valuable research points to spend on trading, diplomacy, warfare, farming or religion. Beware as your power grows so does your responsibility. Your vassals will look to you for leadership and you may find yourself fighting for the crown itself!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDT045","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Adventure of Stars","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15960.9007199266599602.1c08c59b-58c1-4a9d-9351-0ea731144851.a6ab998d-4bee-4a0a-bbb9-63996ffe3d9d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23070.9007199266599602.a461842b-fb8d-4292-8c28-a128ddec7025.ba393f9b-84bc-4825-ab2d-701a60a11561","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33485.9007199266599602.93dd3a19-7a11-4d75-8e13-b492dd6fa9f1.de12c172-df00-402d-8f8a-bb1dcd71a387","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["22741LiliGames.AdventureofStars_ck0fv1xw344cm"],"ContentIds":["55f82e91-5428-0327-78ef-33ed08bbedcf","98c8f58a-2472-af3d-9b87-ee13dbc546af"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Adventure of Stars is an exciting and addictive puzzle game for everyone! \r\nYou need to rescue stars in limited moves to pass a level, stars can be rescued only when they reach the bottom.\r\nYou can use strategy and boosts to score more points and compete with friends from all over the world.\r\n\r\nHINTS \r\n• Tap a group of 3 or more cubes with same color to destroy them \r\n• Rescue stars by making they reach the bottom of the board \r\n• Fill your energy to cast a lightning to destroy a whole line \r\n• Explosive metal blocks reached the bottom will destroy all the blocks of one color \r\n• Use Boosts to get you back in game! \r\n\r\nHIGHLIGHTS \r\n• 75 levels to beat \r\n• Challenging and exciting gameplay \r\n• Incredible graphics and illustrations \r\n\r\nDozens of levels to beat are sure to keep you entertained for days. \r\nCan you clear all the challenging puzzles of Adventure of Stars?

Make sure you drive straight and don’t crash into buildings as that will stop you from reaching the hospital in time and can also be fatal for the patients.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3TFH0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Can You Escape - Island","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.30580.13510798884696985.174d1032-9bbd-426f-84e0-279c9100cb55.49796d98-d47b-4972-9f42-c77d10b1987a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31331.13510798884696985.f1dfd96e-6a40-465c-ad24-05e5ee1f773a.b374450a-0200-4daa-971a-bb28d04486ec","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6308.13510798884696985.d1ab437d-42d4-4011-8122-cb793c3019dc.dadd0cfd-dcf9-42bd-be95-ae1e05b42052","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.6041.13510798884696985.0ac01fa5-b047-4708-a6ae-d9c77d4d3d9d.5f4c8e4c-044a-4ba7-9039-a8629387d4c1","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25028.13510798884696985.7614361d-6714-423c-b642-a86b1d62592d.28192496-ff20-4075-9040-5265f8ab2800","Height":434,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.13794.13510798884696985.e3511d40-a58f-4e3c-b71d-c2c75cc86a5d.92f2dde2-0ae6-4441-8e77-6cd72f066e07","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.31638.13510798884696985.a5c5ead9-6ee3-4d1f-b761-49e1c607ef3c.1f826f8e-358b-4c0e-84ae-d626d5275fe1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.46227.13510798884696985.ebecc18e-236f-44b2-a152-4584200a01e7.7c70e2ac-4033-4873-a41d-6fc70d5a1c96","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25807.13510798884696985.d79e7d7f-b6a2-4aa9-bc21-5504c7dbac69.10ad80fd-affb-4320-be59-9b9313d55c2a","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15076.13510798884696985.e1fcf600-fa53-4352-96b2-0a7fc8cd2713.639419ac-76ee-4502-9665-36a228f5807d","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["Trapped.CanYouEscape-Island_bhn6e84ggqs1p"],"ContentIds":["a2d7316e-a630-2074-8a88-3f9cf29328a8","10862224-1f3b-d686-9e6e-5381a04d30c4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"If you think that this island is deserted, then you are mistaken.\r\nYou were thrown on the island shore after surviving a terrible shipwreck.

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJB32","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Shooting Showdown","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.21915.9007199266251987.da06413e-2d8c-48b9-a828-7ac22949f374.296fa2f7-e06a-4172-b270-84c20dc94c8a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.19277.9007199266251987.34f9ce25-2145-4100-8991-aac2c0655b7c.ec9b9af7-0384-45d8-b7e8-ec897e3b36e1","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["NaquaticLLC.ShootingShowdown_mx4czwxn42djm"],"ContentIds":["2df45fc7-7b7e-bd6b-a506-ada7730e0018"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Experience the trick shooting game that changed the FPS genre forever.

Build, expand, plan your strategy, the decision is in your hands!\r\nBut don’t stop there, recruit dozens of funny characters, add them to your collection and watch as they populate the streets and bring your city to life!\r\n\r\nBuild the BEST. CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to

Put on a uniform, fill up a gun and show them who is the boss.\r\n \r\nMice Invasion is an action game where you have to fight army of attacking mice trying to steal everything from your farm even your underwear. Your task is to prevent them doing so at any costs. In the role of a brave tomcat, you stand behind your loyal cannon and defend the farm. Don't be mistaken it seems like an easy task but it's definitely not. There are lots of them and their muskets aim really precisely.\r\n \r\nThere are 45 levels full of action prepared for you. During these, you will meet four kinds of mouse attackers on three different battlefields. Gradually, you will be finding new kinds of ammunition for your loyal gun.\r\n\r\nBesides the level mode, you can play survival mode where you choose a battlefield and face the endless floods of enemies. If you are competitive you can measure your skill with your friends or other players in online score. Can you be the best?\r\n \r\nGame principle is easy. A cat with a gun is placed in the lower part of a screen, you move sideways with a gun by tilting a mobile device and shoot by tapping on the screen. Mice are going from the top of the screen, every now and then they stop, aim and shoot. Each received shot lowers cat’s determination to protect the farm as well as every mouse slipping through its barricade. When the determination reaches zero, game ends; but don't worry, you can try it again.\r\n\r\nOne last thing you will not manage with only shooting and dodging. The game is not about fast reflexes only. To successfully repulse all attacking waves it is necessary to use different kinds of ammunition and their bonuses correctly. SPOILER: focus on higher enemy ranks which provide individual waves with various bonuses; when they run away, a wave loses these bonuses.\r\n\r\nInformation about enemy soldiers, cannon ammunition and control is described in Help page in the game. \r\n \r\nIn a nutshell: \r\n•\t45 levels full of action\r\n•\t4 kinds of enemies\r\n•\t4 + 1 kinds of ammunition\r\n•\t3 different battlefields\r\n•\tSurvival mode with online rankings\r\n•\tChallenges (can you complete them all?) \r\n•\tAll this in a beautiful animated graphics inspired by the period of the Napoleonic Wars \r\n \r\nIf you like the game, you can buy additional uniform sets for the enemy soldiers as well as for the cat defender in the shop. You can buy cool ammunition, too. However, this ammunition is not necessary to finish the game (all levels can be completed without using it :)).\r\n\r\nDon't wait, download now and enjoy :)\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGXTN84","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Julia's World","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59656.13510798883792667.f1ecb3dc-24ca-4094-a7b4-79aa2fb0eb40.171969a9-2076-4b22-822a-a9415719171a","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39385.13510798883792667.2b5f497f-e6c6-4dda-a60b-52785599ce39.b69135f8-1c7c-40e3-9bba-261edcbccd68","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40557.13510798883792667.1bb132e0-3a3b-4707-b178-1567d1d32827.1f7fb243-aac7-4e44-a95f-ff263b8e13e9","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52360.13510798883792667.16649a0e-e11d-4011-ad62-a019eebfb7bc.95ac73ec-1e23-4ca3-96c8-579bb8db008e","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33552.13510798883792667.0b62a69a-ceca-4f7e-aefd-a3ef82297753.4bca2118-de35-48c3-9b47-1499a9e19ab2","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21725.13510798883792667.d00b7871-f69b-40ea-bdb8-0ada5ce7af11.c63641fc-390b-4a85-99b5-529038e8992b","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41109.13510798883792667.b9f06f32-fe6f-4a45-9615-8e58277ee105.33b4e9a7-2522-4eb3-b998-79bd64fcff46","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#3C3C3C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["BrainCrookLLC.JuliasWorld_sj746s7rvy8z2"],"ContentIds":["cdc0b505-2be2-ef11-5953-15c4f5b737aa","35fdede2-81dc-ef54-9baf-ab994bff593e"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Really nice jump'n'run with several unique chapters and many challenging enemies!

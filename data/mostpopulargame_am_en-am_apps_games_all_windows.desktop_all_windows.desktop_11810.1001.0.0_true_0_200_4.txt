An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDM83R","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Malware Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44108.9007199266446974.7f4db524-c9a4-43da-811f-038c97d4c639.e0ee19fe-a3cc-408d-a651-b8b6a8d6f355","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18256.9007199266446974.3799d3c9-3d4e-4ca4-b3cc-d3804449dbbd.e4ce3c10-c374-45d6-8928-e687a8750434","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["13346ATVProduction.DefenseoftheMalware_xxfkq25b9ybge"],"ContentIds":["1fdbec80-7eab-5ca8-2978-b7c921b01958"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Malware begin to attack our system.

Playing this game is rather simple: Move the bird on the twig by using your mouse or simply touching the screen. Once you have positioned the bird click below the twig and bird drop will start falling although not quite according to the laws of physics which I must admit. It is all about timing: You will get more points if you position the bird as far left as possible and if you hit the car close to the rear. If you trigger too early you can deploy a parachute slicing the speed of decent by half. This however will reduce the points you may gather by 50%. If you click a third time the parachute will disappear and the bird drop will fall at its original speed. But if you do so you will only collect 25% of the possible points. Not dropping at all will cost you 100 points from your cumulative score. A simple and fun game for kids! An absurd game for adults – if you are in the right mood...   ;-)\r\n(en-us, 1.1.0.9)","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDP955","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Memory Violetta","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30930.9007199266632912.c86485af-f3f1-4c54-9a8f-f01751f5952a.96524c75-f4a1-4e69-b678-b65145070386","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5713.9007199266632912.fe0c906d-4938-4c8e-b6b9-210e50df385e.bcebf799-8fea-4325-b1f4-a0c566d9b0cf","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["7341LadyAnna.MemoryVioletta_gp9729xr5bjr0"],"ContentIds":["b3031dee-9d78-be31-64cd-286edd5ef664"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Violetta memory game with 3 level, very funny, where you will find many of your favorite characters.

Not a lot, just a little bit, every day, hidden away in a vent. This was no easy feat in a totalitarian world where everything and every person was accounted for every minute of the day. A genius scientist, Number 221 was under orders to mass produce chemical missiles and viruses that would be strategically spread to deal with population control. He was under contract. Under orders. Under control. Number 221 was planning mutiny. But how do you destroy monsters without becoming one of them? There was no guarantee he'd survive. The medicine dissolved easily in the coffee, leaving no trace of evidence behind. He poured a cup for himself, and his guard. He sipped the poison, the antidote tucked safely in his lab coat. His guard did not have the same benefit. As his insides began to write in result, he waited for evidence the poison too was effecting his companion. As the man fell to the ground, Number 221 flipped the lid of the vial and tossed back the contents. The guard was a fool to trust a scientist, especially one willing to drink his own poison to ensure his success. Number 221 stepped over the body, drew a vial of the odious man's blood to pass security, and slipped from the lab he knew all too well. He wasn't anywhere close to being free. The safe house was a far way off and they would notice his absence soon. They would not risk losing him. He was too valuable. To survive, he was going to need to be careful. He was going to need to fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n★☆★☆Battle for Supremacy ★☆★☆\r\nAre you skilled enough, fast enough, powerful enough, and capable enough to eliminate all targets and complete the map in a designated time?

Clear stages to unlock new balls.\r\n\r\nONE HUNDRED PINS\r\n\r\nKnock down as many pins as you can in 5 throws at a rack of 100 pins!\r\n\r\nCANDLEPIN BOWLING\r\n\r\nInvented in 1880. Candlepin bowling offers a great challenge. Candlepins are thin skittles that bounce and spin unpredictably when struck. Pins aren't cleared between rounds allowing you to knock them into still upright pins.\r\n\r\nFIVE PIN BOWLING\r\n\r\n Invented in 1904 in Canada. In 5 pin, each pin is worth different point values. Spares are strategic attempts to hit the most valuable pins. A perfect game is 450 points!\r\n\r\nNINE PIN (GERMAN BOWLING)\r\n\r\nInvented in medieval Germany, 9 pin is what most later bowling games are based on. Nine pins are arranged in a diamond shape with a \"kingpin\" in the middle. Knocking all the pins over earns 9 points. Knocking all the pins over but the kingpin earns 12!\r\n\r\nLONG ALLEY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nKnock over pins by throwing a barrel-shaped 'cheese'! To score points, you first have to knock over the kingpin. It's tricky to master when the ball bounces unpredictably!\r\n\r\nDUCK PIN\r\n\r\nInvented in 1904 in New England. Duck pin uses the nearly the same rules as 10 pin, but allows 3 rounds to knock over all the pins. The ball and pins are smaller making precision very important to score well!\r\n\r\nIRON PIN\r\n\r\nIron pin is the same as normal bowling but one random pin is much heavier than the others. Careful consideration has to be made on how to knock over the heavy pin while also clearing the normal ones.\r\n\r\nSHUFFLE BOWLING\r\n\r\nBowling on a shuffleboard table! Knock over the pins with a weighted puck.\r\n\r\nWEST COUNTY SKITTLES\r\n\r\nTraditional skittles game that has been played in British pubs for centuries.\r\n\r\nGalaxy Bowling has an option to purchase Candlepin, Duck Pin, Five Pin, Nine Pin, 100 pin, and Iron Pin variants. Ten pin, and spares mode are included free.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDL77S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"What's Pixelated - word picture guessing rearranging puzzle game and acclaimed brain developer suitable for all ages","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.1308.9007199266409457.45d5dd64-237c-4dc8-81fb-f64e5603292b.1638dd67-06c2-4833-a445-6f863ddb9aac","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.17040.9007199266409457.ddde6f7b-5cd2-4d45-995f-589f1cab402c.1498e3da-099f-41ed-b43f-8b39d4972976","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49885.9007199266409457.e7eff6e7-ee4d-430e-a09f-7cee79ffbb48.d8114fff-f276-4f72-b70c-84fde4528341","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.48476.9007199266409457.1e804a3d-f2b1-49f5-8b93-d48ebbfe9464.817eab3b-3224-4e46-b696-aa69c7760662","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.60479.9007199266409457.41fb9314-4a01-4cf5-b552-0aa46425de46.d2d0a8c9-1dcb-4573-be5f-0c3c571f665b","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.8976.9007199266409457.3b1b4688-78b7-48ae-9caf-e397dd5347c9.3f0c2c5b-53fd-4d3d-896a-ddb757081343","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.23038.9007199266409457.09dd1f66-cf61-47fe-8a95-30aee25b8fb4.af18fccd-c103-4d46-a199-d325e41fe259","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["EspacePtyLtd.WhatsPixelated-wordandpictureguessing_38khqxevzecjw"],"ContentIds":["7720c42c-fbc8-aa7a-6ae5-10e8906eede4","1caffd65-624d-e8eb-8a62-725701711473"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Do you enjoy challenging and yet addictive and fun word games? `What`s Pixelated?` is a brand new game concept from the award winning puzzle game developers bringing something fresh to the market for word puzzle lovers and fanatics.\r\n\r\nAt the start, the photograph is pixelated and you need to guess the picture based on the part of the picture that`s shown.

Compete against players from around the world in a high speed online race.\r\n\r\nFUN DRIVING \r\nTraffic Race 3D 2 is a mixture of arcade racing and casual driving on open tracks. No more re-spawns when you hit the race track border. Go crazy and find the fastest route on each track. \r\n\r\nENDLESS RUNNER GAME MODE \r\nWe’ve invented a combination of endless running mode with a checkpoint system. You will not die because you crash, your car will take damage but just keep on going for as far as you can! \r\n\r\nGLOBAL HIGH SCORE\r\nAre you the best driver in the world? Now you can prove it! Show the world that you are the next Schumacher or Hamilton. Can you make it to 1st place in the global rank? We reset ranks every week on Mondays to keep the competition alive.  \r\n\r\nARCADE RACING PHYSICS\r\nWe’ve taken inspiration from all extreme motor sports: Nascar, F1, Le mans, Rally and then we’ve stripped it down to a casual driving experience. This lets you drift around corners at 240 km/h with your car while still having fun and do crash as often as you wish. \r\n\r\nSUITABLE FOR ALL AGES (PEGI 3)\r\nEveryone can enjoy Traffic Race 3D 2. You will actually probably become a better real driver regardless if you are an adult, teenager or child. \r\n\r\nINTUITIVE CONTROLS\r\nThe goal of this game is to make it easy and fast to run on any device (Mobile, PC, Tablet). \r\n\r\nCAMERA OF YOUR CHOICE\r\nWe’ve added the opportunity for you to switch camera mode between Chase, Helicopter or cockpit view so you really feel that you are driving a real car.  \r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE – AI DRIVERS\r\nOur game includes AI drivers but our drivers are not perfect. They make mistakes and will not always stay on the track, probably just like you :o)\r\n\r\n100% FREE – WE PROMISE\r\nYou can unlock all cars and courses for free. You do not need to buy any smurf coins to play this game. Each time you race you gain coins to unlock cars. Courses can only be unlocked by achieving the best times on each track.  We do offer one IAP and we call it “All Inclusive”, it gives you all cars and eliminates all ads. \r\n\r\nFEEDBACK\r\nWe are listening to feedback from our users.

Starting with Windows 98 other version of solitaire joined the suit - FreeCell, Spider, Tri-Peaks and Pyramid. As a part of the standard Windows installation those games have been popularized around the world. For each of those games millions of clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We combined all six games (Klondike, Spider, FreeCell, Tri-Peaks and two flavors of Pyramid) in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe fun of original games is preserved but some improvement are made to make it easier to play on the small factor devices. In particular, you don't have to drag individual cards - drag&drop whole column, only proper cards will move the rest will snap back. The scoring all the games is simplified to track only number of moves to solve the puzzle. If you stuck, feel free to use hints or undo - implemented by all the games. Use menu (top-tight corner) to change the game type, difficulty, check score, help or to start a new game.\r\n\r\nDon't forget to check our Game section for other fun games...","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH4TRCM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Olympus Rising: Hero Defense","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64455.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.6b017157-dbaa-43e5-9854-4c8ccb70dec1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58412.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.b9a9d0d2-b66b-46ce-9120-637bde56cd68","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17474.13510798887612598.b6bb054a-1b5e-4c52-9911-92db98bba24a.b2f1b339-a72c-4236-b7c4-32eee1ed5401","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9623.13510798887612598.58af8917-e6c4-495f-b44c-7b34c8c26c58.5bc1c312-4c16-4801-bd1f-520031219d3d","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64455.13510798887612598.617c41cb-7076-4761-857e-de26cdb39580.6b017157-dbaa-43e5-9854-4c8ccb70dec1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["flaregamesGmbH.OlympusRising_g0q0z3kw54rap"],"ContentIds":["7e27b898-d668-d1fa-e99a-f0b999508d28","4fb77dd2-edb1-1302-52a3-8020adfda6bb"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“Olympus Rising features striking 3D visuals and the presentation is brilliant…The narrative of the game is impressive, and leading your army through the enemy defenses is great fun with seamless controls.” - ONMSFT\r\n\r\nDownload Olympus Rising now, and prove that you have what it takes to become a god in this cutting-edge action-strategy game!\r\n \r\n- Fight large-scale battles with hundreds of units\r\n- Customise your unique team of Heroes with almost infinite variations of powerful loot\r\n- Recruit fantastic beasts from Greek myth and legend\r\n- Build a fabulous city on Mount Olympus\r\n- Strategically design your defenses to defeat attacking players\r\n- Form an unbeatable Alliance and fight epic campaigns in the Alliance Wars\r\n \r\n- - - Terms of Service and Privacy Policy - - -\r\nBy accessing or using a Flaregames product, you're agreeing to our Terms of Service (www.flaregames.com/terms-service/) and Privacy Policy (http://www.flaregames.com/privacy-policy/).\r\n\r\n- - - Parental Guide - - -\r\nOlympus Rising is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money.

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDHB8P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Perfect Shift","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38015.9007199266339250.0f8aef31-84a2-49e5-b275-4b415af9801b.0937569e-abcd-4a95-a393-fab39f9dff35","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54139.9007199266339250.11f46f4a-88a2-4d18-a6ee-093ef44fccde.1081b795-923d-43a7-b33f-6b65815bc73b","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.55628.9007199266339250.e20fe469-ca50-49bd-8fc2-1a92315635db.58c75688-e45d-40ba-a3ff-267e40c0c9fa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["Lextre.PerfectShift_j7ch1pvxn64yc"],"ContentIds":["658cfc8b-c6eb-6fcc-769b-5850067bd7fb","b5c26436-4eb8-1ad7-019c-c64e8bbeaa62","081ed016-2973-572d-1e38-bd9e2abb45ed"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"*** Windows Phone Store Spotlight Featured & Top Ranked in All Markets ***\r\n\r\n«A fantastic game to fill your need for speed» - Windows Central\r\n\r\n«One of few must-have apps for your new tablet and smartphone» - Daily Star\r\n\r\n«A visually stunning drag racing game» - WinBeta\r\n\r\nList of Top-100 apps: «a fantastic looking drag racing game» - Lumia Conversation UK\r\n\r\n***Due to popular demand, the Perfect Shift soundtrack can also now be downloaded on xBox Music, so you can listen to your favourite tunes from the game even when you’re not playing!***\r\n\r\nThis high-octane Perfect Shift game lets you compete with challengers in a visually stunning 3D race environment that looks great on any device.\r\n\r\nChallenge the toughest opponents to race in abandoned tunnels, on deserted city streets and dark industrial areas.

Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDNB1Z","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"123 Free Solitaire","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43373.9007199266467332.42ac8c7f-90bd-4dd8-b323-09bb7b6e103e.8c438531-42af-4d99-9ce9-2782390a9db8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16827.9007199266467332.fe9c6240-7e34-4803-bccf-758798cb0794.f971d1db-bab4-4b44-88be-b0931ed3e566","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26223.9007199266467332.3615661e-8749-4cff-8783-597b37919acb.044ab039-793a-41b0-98bf-7cc68de8a235","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.45660.9007199266467332.7db09c5d-84b0-42d4-9539-c3becbb2c496.5cdf66ea-79d5-4f08-a250-5f757b632c0f","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44771.9007199266467332.1aeded92-5a3b-457b-a1cb-6b630c7c5dae.41fec3ee-dd00-45f8-a46a-5a84446a0577","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57183.9007199266467332.6cbee0fd-bfee-4222-b358-2147b031d025.3464a4e1-c0ff-48a2-bc8a-254384b64e85","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62581.9007199266467332.49732159-fd5e-4d1a-b1c5-4d9907999e57.a39e9d60-9d16-47ab-892b-17fff6c339fc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23137.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.056d5314-51f2-4d0b-8c9b-73218fecf699","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7212.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.46c63a9d-f615-4d90-af28-6f5acf5160c8","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#50A67A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61338.9007199266467332.7f221449-fb50-4b8e-93ec-0062caceef9b.2c0aad89-5336-4534-bc04-51780fec1e5f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["TreeCardGames.123FreeSolitaire_n666hb6ddc5jp"],"ContentIds":["1ac3a72d-239c-cb6d-06a0-a84337eb2fe7","41933c6b-7e53-f421-076e-6bba4f106e18"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"123 Free Solitaire is the Microsoft Store version of the award-winning solitaire card game with millions of downloads since 1998.
